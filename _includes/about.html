                                    <p class="text-muted">I had a very general education during my first three years, including political sciences, economics, history and sociology. During my year in Italy, I decided to focus on the history of arts, with a special interest in the pre-Renaissance paintings that were all around me. For my master, I specialised in Strategy, with a minor of Finance, that led me to my first work experiences in the tech industry</p>

                                    <strong>Business development Intern at M6, a french TV Channel</strong></br>Being a Business Development Intern in an industry trying to digitalize itself was, quite surprisingly, a very good way to discover the tech industry. As they were trying to diversify their activities, my main mission was to watch and identify emerging web and mobile businesses. This activity made me discover and study many companies trying to make its way in the web industry â€¦ and convinced me to work in this part of the industry rather than in a more traditional company. </p>

Talking to my colleagues at the product, I was however frustrated to stand only on the business side and I was quite intrigued by the power of realisation and creation that comes form coding. After a few hours spent on the web, learning a few things by myself, I realised that I wanted to learn much more about it ! </p>

The  ambitious program of the course taught me to adapt myself quickly to different languages and to switch easily between them as well as it helped me to really improve my learning process. To sum-up, an exciting, intensive, challenging and incredibly satisfaying experience !</p>
