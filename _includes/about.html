During my year in Italy, I decided to focus on the history of arts, with a special interest in the pre-Renaissance paintings that were all around me. For my Master, I specialised in Finance and Strategy, that led me to my first work experiences in the tech industry</p>

After talking to the product management team and the development team, I was quite intrigued by the power of creation and production that comes form coding. After a few hours spent on the web, learning a few things by myself, I realised that I wanted to learn more about it ! </p>

The  ambitious learning structure of the course taught me to adapt myself quickly to different languages and to switch easily between them as well as it helped me to really improve my learning capabilities. To sum-up, an exciting, intensive, challenging and incredibly satisfaying experience!</p>
